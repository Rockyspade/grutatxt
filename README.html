<h2 class=level2>Intro</h2>
<p>
Grutatxt is a plain text to HTML converter. It succesfully converts subtle
text markup to lists, bold, italics, tables and headings to their
corresponding HTML tags without having to write unreadable source text files.
<p>
To install Grutatxt, just do
<p>
<pre>
	 $ make
</pre>
<p>
and then, as root
<p>
<pre>
	 # make install
</pre>
<p>
Grutatxt includes several command-line arguments; see them using
<p>
<pre>
	 $ grutatxt --help
</pre>
<p>
This README file contains all the marks that Grutatxt is able to
understand so that it serves also as a demo. So, to see how this file will
look after being converted by Grutatxt, you can just do
<p>
<pre>
	 $ grutatxt &lt; README &gt; README.html
</pre>
<p>
and see its effects.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Text paragraphs</h2>
<p>
A text paragraph is any group of lines containing text delimited by one or
more blank lines, provided that none of them beings with a blank space.
So, you just write lines as usual (wrapping or not), and separates
paragraphs as in a word processor.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Headings</h2>
<p>
A line is understand as a heading if it's immediately followed by another
one that contains only a repetition of a special character (see 'Text
paragraphs' and 'Headings' for an example). There are three heading
levels depending on this special character: if it's a line of = (equal
sign), it's a first level heading, used for titles and tagged with h1 HTML
tags. If it's - (hyphen), it's a second level heading, and it it's ~
(tilde), a third level one. This document shows the three heading levels.
It's suggested that the first level heading is used only once, as it's
magically taken as the title for the HTML page, if one is not overriden as
a command line argument.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Text effects</h2>
<p>
If some text is surrounded by asterisks, as <strong class=strong>this one</strong>, it's marked as
bold (you probably wrote text this way in email to emphasize something).
As well, text surrounded by the _ symbol (underscore), as <em class=em>this one</em>, is
marked as italic. Bold can also be marked up surrounding the text with three
apostrophes (<strong class=strong>this way</strong>) and italics with two (<em class=em>this way</em>). If you ever
used a WikiWikiWeb system you'll be familiar with these ones.
<p>
Other special text is automatically recognized, as URLs (so the URL
<a href="http://www.triptico.com">http://www.triptico.com</a> should be clickable). Grutatxt can also be useful
documenting source code, as function names like <code class=funcname>printf()</code> or variables like
<code class=varname>$username</code> are also highlighted. There are command line arguments to make
the parenthesis and / or leading dollar to disappear from the output
document.
<p>
URLs are simply substituted as shown above; if an URL is followed by a
phrase surrounded by parentheses (just like you naturally would do to
explain the contents of a web), this phrase is used as the link text,
as in this example pointing to
<a href="http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html">Grutatxt Home Page</a>.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Lists</h2>
<p>
Grutatxt is powerful rendering lists. There are three types of lists:
unnumbered ones (bulleted), numbered ones and definition lists. They are
recognized as lines starting with a blank (space or tab) immediately
followed by an special character.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unnumbered lists start with a blank, followed by an asterisk, followed   by another blank. If the following lines are three-space indented, they
   are assumed as part of the same list element. The asterisk can also be
   a - (hyphen).

<li>Numbered list are marked up almost the same, just by substuting the   asterisk by a # (sharp) or 1 (number one).

<li>Definition lists are marked up almost the same, but delimiting the   definition term from the definition itself by a colon. These lists are
   rendered using tables, unless you specify a command line argument to
   force them being rendered with standard &lt;dl&gt; HTML marks (too ugly
   for me).

</ul>
<p>
<h3 class=level3>List examples</h3>
<p>
Unnumbered list:
<p>
<ul>
<li>First element.
<li>The second one.
<li>The third one.
</ul>
<p>
Numbered list:
<p>
<ol>
<li>First element.
<li>The second one.
<li>The third one.
</ol>
<p>
Definition list:
<p>
<table >
<tr><td valign=top><strong class=strong>first</strong class=strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>the first element
<tr><td valign=top><strong class=strong>second</strong class=strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>the second element
<tr><td valign=top><strong class=strong>third</strong class=strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>the third element
</table>
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Preformatted text</h2>
<p>
A text that should be rendered as is should be written with at least a
blank in the beginning of all lines. This can be an example:
<p>
<pre>
 int main(int argc, char * argv[])
 {
	/* an example of useless C code */
	return(0);
 }
</pre>
<p>
If you ever wrote any Perl POD documentation, you'll be familiar with this.
<p>
If you happen to be using preformatted text that collisions with list
definitions (i.e. text with lines beginning with blank, asterisk, blank or
similar), just use more than one blank in the beginning of each line.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>HTML</h2>
<p>
If you need to insert HTML as is (for rendering, say, images or
complicated layouts), you can also do it. Anything between a line
containing only two &lt; symbols and a line containing two &gt; symbols will be
passed without any further processing. So, to insert an image, just do
this:
<p>
<center>
<img src='http://www.triptico.com/data/themask.jpg'>
</center>
<p>
Any other HTML outside this boundaries is escaped.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Tables</h2>
<p>
But where Grutatxt is really awesome is rendering tables. They are created
using the + (plus) sign for corners, the - (hyphen) for horizontal lines
and the | (pipe) for vertical lines. So this is a table:
<p>
<table border=1 >


<tr ><th >  Band Name	  		 </th><th >  Album Name		 			</th><th >  Number of   Songs     </th>

<tr ><td >  Dead Can Dance </td><td >  A Passage in Time	</td><td >  16	    </td>

<tr ><td >  Bel Canto	 </td><td >  White-Out Conditions </td><td >  10	    </td>

<tr ><td >  Depeche Mode	 </td><td >  Speak and Spell	</td><td >  16	    </td>


<tr ><td >  Love Spirals	   Downwards	 </td><td >  Temporal		 			</td><td >  13	     	    </td>
</table>
<p>
As you can see, cells with long text inside can span several lines of
physical text, provided that you delimit table rows with a new line
containing only + and - symbols.
<p>
A column can also span several ones, just by marking the intersections
with | (pipe) instead of + (plus). Look in this example how it's done:
<p>
<table border=1 >

<tr ><th >  Head 1    </th><th >  Head 2	  </th><th >  Head 3	</th><th >  Head 4    </th>

<tr ><td >  Cell 1-1  </td><td  colspan=2>  Cell spanning two 	</td><td  colspan=2>  Cell 1-3  </td>

<tr ><td >  Cell 2-1  </td><td >  Cell 2-2	  </td><td >  Cell 2-3	</td><td >  Cell 2-4  </td>

<tr ><td >  Cell 3-1  </td><td  colspan=3>  Cell spanning three		    </td>
</table>
<p>
It's not possible to span rows by now.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Separators</h2>
<p>
A separator line (horizontal ruler) can be inserted by typing four or more
hyphens alone in a line. To avoid being confused with a second level
heading, insert a blank line just before. To the end of this document
there should be a separator, above my signature.
<p>
<h2 class=level2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Grutatxt is part of a bigger project, Gruta, a hyerarchical CGI notepad   being developed.
